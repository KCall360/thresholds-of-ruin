# Test-effectiveness ledger

Keep a small, evidence-backed record of what tests actually catch and what
maintenance they cost. This is not a pass-count leaderboard, a new merge gate or
a requirement to audit every run. Update it at a coherent fix checkpoint when a
useful finding is established. The [testing policy](testing.md) owns coverage,
execution cadence and qualification.

## Counting and classification

- **Production defect:** implementation violates the supported contract; retain
  the intended failing assertion, correction and green regression evidence.
  Say whether it was caught during development or in released/published code.
- **Documentation defect:** a correct test catches wrong documentation. Do not
  call this an outdated test merely because the repair changes prose.
- **Stale/unupdated test:** an approved contract changed but a fixture, mock,
  driver or expected value did not. Establish the intended contract before
  changing the test; never assume a red assertion is stale because code changed.
- **Harness/infrastructure:** setup, build, driver, environment or evidence
  collection prevented/invalidated the intended check. This is not proof of a
  later gameplay failure. A method may have both stale-fixture and harness
  failures; flag that overlap instead of forcing disjoint totals.
- **Unresolved:** insufficient evidence to decide. Keep it visible but outside
  confirmed defect/stale counts until diagnosed. Deliberate new-feature first-red
  work and mutation sensitivity are separate from naturally detected defects.

Count **distinct root causes**, **distinct failing test methods** (fully qualified
owner plus method), and **failed method executions** separately. One root can
break many methods; rerunning a method or running it on another OS/profile adds
executions, not bugs or distinct methods. Multiple assertions/subtests within a
method do not multiply its method count. A suite/job failure is not another test
failure. Record errors, cancellations, waivers and not-run checks separately.
Define the evidence window and deduplicate before adding totals; never extrapolate
a repository-lifetime count from a partial set of logs.

## Seed audit: Polymorph development, 26 October 2026

Reviewed on 27 October, covering the pre-correction library snapshot, local
`full02` Python stage, initial four hosted Rust lanes and the later inspected
Linux-debug Rust repair lane for [PR #198](https://github.com/KCall360/thresholds-of-ruin/pull/198).
The production list below also uses its bounded focused red/green witnesses.
These are **development defects**, not claims that broken behavior reached main.

**Confirmed in this window: 5 production bug roots, 1 documentation defect,
and 49 distinct stale/unupdated test methods.** The stale methods account for
**61 observed failed/error method executions** in the enumerated snapshots (10 + 32 +
16 + 3). That is a lower bound for the development effort, not a lifetime total
or all PR attempts. One stale method also had a harness error. A global stale
root-cause count is not established; maintenance categories below are not bugs.
No production-versus-stale percentage is inferred from this selected sample.

### Genuine defects caught

| ID | Defect and observed failure | Retained regression and correction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | Paid Polymorph used a provisional outcome after publication finalized the receipt; the visible changed-form case failed with `Rule(InvalidPlan)` after its positive saved-outcome case. | `abilities::polymorph_tests::paid_polymorph_identifies_only_immediate_visible_changed_form` in [Polymorph ability tests](https://github.com/KCall360/thresholds-of-ruin/blob/a5b6aaa98f2a893028434d8a1bdefcbf7cd01fba/crates/simulation/src/abilities/polymorph_tests.rs). [Execution](https://github.com/KCall360/thresholds-of-ruin/blob/a5b6aaa98f2a893028434d8a1bdefcbf7cd01fba/crates/simulation/src/abilities/execution.rs) now consumes the authoritative committed receipt, retaining the equality guard. Exact regression subsequently passed. |
| P2 | ChooseAgain restoration resurrected a drained Lore purchase instead of restoring an empty choice slot. The ordinary paid purchase/drain/earned-restoration witness reached its intended assertion and found Lore still present. | External red/green witness `OwnedChooseAgainFirstRed.test_owned_choose_again_discards_drained_lore`; permanent `creatures::body_tests::owned_choose_again_preserves_health_and_funding_not_removed_choices` in [body tests](https://github.com/KCall360/thresholds-of-ruin/blob/a5b6aaa98f2a893028434d8a1bdefcbf7cd01fba/crates/simulation/src/creatures/body_tests.rs). Preserve funded identity, Health and purchase high-water marks, not removed choices. Both ordinary witness and retained regression passed. |
| P3 | Authored restoration refused a lawful sixth retained ordinary attribute receipt despite effective Strength cap 5; valid setup/drain/allocation succeeded, but total HD stayed 24 instead of restoring 25. | External red/green `AuthoredRestoreCapFirstRed.test_retained_authored_sixth_receipt_restores_with_effective_five`; permanent `creatures::body_tests::authored_restoration_reunites_six_lawful_physical_receipts_without_forging_birth` in [body tests](https://github.com/KCall360/thresholds-of-ruin/blob/a5b6aaa98f2a893028434d8a1bdefcbf7cd01fba/crates/simulation/src/creatures/body_tests.rs). Retain raw ownership and cap its effective contribution. This proves a privileged-builder boundary, not ordinary advancement UI acceptance. Both witnesses subsequently passed. |
| P4 | Strict ChooseAgain decoding accepted extra fields; the malformed restoration payload unexpectedly deserialized. | `creatures::record::body::tests::personal_restoration_records_require_policy_and_exact_stable_birth_owners` in [record tests](https://github.com/KCall360/thresholds-of-ruin/blob/a5b6aaa98f2a893028434d8a1bdefcbf7cd01fba/crates/simulation/src/creatures/record/body.rs). An empty struct variant replaces the permissive unit variant without changing valid JSON shape; exact focused regression passed. |
| P5 | AdvancementGrowth validation rejected valid owned zero-personal-HD/body-loss states: Wraith owner-page retrieval failed, and the Strength restoration witness received “Advancement is unavailable.” | `session::advancement_tests::canonical_wraith_earned_regrowth_survives_source_free_service_reopen` in [advancement tests](https://github.com/KCall360/thresholds-of-ruin/blob/a5b6aaa98f2a893028434d8a1bdefcbf7cd01fba/crates/server/src/advancement_session_tests.rs), and `session::magic_item_tests::self_devices::growth_potions::imported_strength_restores_exclusively_then_reaches_combined_cap_independent_of_ring` in [growth tests](https://github.com/KCall360/thresholds-of-ruin/blob/a5b6aaa98f2a893028434d8a1bdefcbf7cd01fba/crates/server/src/growth_potion_session_tests.rs). [DTO validation](https://github.com/KCall360/thresholds-of-ruin/blob/a5b6aaa98f2a893028434d8a1bdefcbf7cd01fba/crates/protocol/src/advancement.rs) accounts for full authored body capacity while retaining strict bounds; both exact regressions and added capacity checks passed. Count this as one root, not two bugs. |
| D1 | The documentation test correctly detected a stale ruleset identity in a historical consumables checkpoint. | `test_documentation.DocumentationTests.test_documents_do_not_mention_other_versions`; corrected the historical prose rather than weakening the current-guide check. The repaired method passed. This is not a stale-test failure. |

P1's red was observed in a diagnostic build with unrelated reviewed production
reversals; it was additional to those intended mutations. Its traced receipt
mismatch, narrow correction and subsequent green support the classification;
the diagnostic is not an unmodified-baseline full run. The ten intentional core
mutation witnesses are not counted as ten additional naturally detected bugs.
Other feature/mutation investigations are outside this seed count; unverified
candidates remain pending rather than being promoted from notes alone.

### Stale-test counts and evidence boundaries

| Audited snapshot | Distinct stale methods | Observed stale-affected failed/error executions | Classification detail |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Pre-correction simulation/server library run | 10 | 10 | Of 13 failed methods, 3 exercised P4/P5 (2 roots); the other 10 had stale fixtures/oracles. |
| Local `full02` Python stage | 32 | 32 | 30 of 31 failed methods were stale; D1 accounts for the other. Two of the 3 error methods also had stale setup, including the mixed spawn case below. |
| [Initial hosted run](https://github.com/KCall360/thresholds-of-ruin/actions/runs/40407638850), Windows/Linux debug/release Rust | 4 | 16 | Same 4 methods on each of 4 lanes; 3 fixture causes, not 16 bugs. |
| [Repair run, Linux-debug Rust](https://github.com/KCall360/thresholds-of-ruin/actions/runs/40413523424/job/121890062812) | 3 | 3 | 3 later methods/fixture causes. Other repair lanes are not included in this execution count. |
| **Deduplicated total within these snapshots** | **49** | **61** | Different snapshots above contain different stale methods; additional reruns are not silently added. |

Library maintenance categories were: unselected restoration career, obsolete
compiled format, old starter HD total, four synthetic perception fixtures,
missing authoring fields, incomplete wand inventory, and obsolete retained-magic
rejection (10 methods).

For `full02`, categories were: old region format (3), missing supported-body
catalog closure (3), missing copied Chill body module (1), obsolete purchase
metadata (7), old starter HD expectations (15), Vampire prefix length (1), old
Extra Healing sole-HD oracle (1), and incomplete compact mock (1): **32 methods**.
The run itself reported **2,139 passed, 31 failed methods, 3 error methods and
100 waived**, with **33 failure assertions**. These are different units, not
contradictory totals and not a successful local full run.

The compact mock errored because its fixture omitted `hit_dice`. The spawn method
had two stale-catalog subtest assertions and a secondary `FileExistsError`; count
that stale method once and record its harness overlap. The other infrastructure
finding was a benchmark helper's 600-second cold Cargo-build timeout **before
benchmark execution**, not a performance assertion. Thus infrastructure affected
two methods in this stage, one overlapping the stale category; do not sum these
categories into an invented outcome total.

Hosted methods and corrections:

- `rogue_chill::rogue_chill_is_a_purchased_checked_status_signature_with_no_fake_damage`:
  author the unpaid variant's matching immutable package, retaining rejection
  under the original package.
- `rogue_roster::production_flying_roster_executes_authored_basic_melee_primaries_and_damage`
  and `rogue_roster::production_flytrap_uses_ordinary_clutch_tightening_and_single_escape`:
  install each newborn's canonical geometry before owned creature admission.
- `scenario_packages::rogue_projectile_content_is_default_available_and_expertise_is_an_ordinary_choice`:
  buy expertise from personal HD, not locked body HD. These four methods were
  fixed in [the server fixture correction](https://github.com/KCall360/thresholds-of-ruin/commit/a202ca6b12377d9bfb945585c2801701c12d471d).
- `advancement_ledger::saved_current_and_authored_purchases_reject_the_257th_owned_talent`:
  supply explicit nullable purchase identity and validate the positive roundtrip.
- `progression::latest_removal_preserves_retained_health_randomness_and_exposes_zero_hd`:
  expect the bound Health policy while retaining exact source/seed assertions.
- `supply_lifecycle::phase5_container_checkpoint_rejects_positional_creature_record`:
  include the new pending-return field before testing positional rejection.
  These three were fixed in [the simulation fixture correction](https://github.com/KCall360/thresholds-of-ruin/commit/5d1f3d90236cbad8e912f6dbd8e172012511e38f).

Both hosted corrections changed fixtures only and their exact four/three local
regressions passed; they did not justify relaxing production admission or strict
rejection. The later local broad run stopped at 626 passes/zero failures by
maintainer direction, not completion. Four repaired methods passed there;
the remaining 30 failed/error methods plus one affected Service-helper witness
passed in a 31-method selection. Sixteen focused Rust boundary checks also
passed. These scoped results are not an exhaustive local pass; final hosted
qualification remains separate, as recorded in PR #198.

**Evidence limits:** this seed was classified from the original local failure
and green receipts plus the specified hosted logs, not only PR prose. Local
raw logs are intentionally uncommitted and are not presented as reader-accessible
links. The linked PR/CI and immutable merged sources preserve public context,
regression assertions and hosted correction diffs; the local occurrence counts
above are the audit summary, not a claim that those links contain every local
receipt. No lifetime failure rate, complete CI-attempt total, or measured speedup
is established. Remaining unreviewed historical failures are **unclassified /
pending**, not zero.

## Add the next useful finding

One compact row or paragraph per diagnosed cause is enough:

> Date / PR / source state; category and supported contract; exact failing test
> IDs and intended red; fix and green evidence (link when available); distinct
> roots / methods / observed failed executions with window and overlaps;
> unresolved or CI-only coverage. Update an existing cause instead of recounting
> it when another OS, profile or rerun exposes the same failure.

Use the findings to improve fixture update lists, cheap preflights and affected
owner selection. They are not a reason to remove strict assertions, security
coverage, unique boundary witnesses or required native CI.
